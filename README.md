# O365EmailDownloader
A Python script designed to read a file containing email received date timestamps, log into the O365 account, and then download the emails with said timestamps as EML files, as well as attachments (this can be disabled).  This functionality is beneficial for a number of purposes, but especially in digital forensics, grabbing targetted Office 365 email evidence.
